This folder is for Peer-graded Assignment: Modern Robotics Course 4 week 1, A* search Project. In this programming assignment, you will implement A* search. Given a graph, the start node, and the goal node, your program will search the graph for a minimum-cost path from the start to the goal. Your program will either return a sequence of nodes for a minimum-cost path or indicate that no solution exists. Project details can be found here: http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/A*_Graph_Search_Project

code.py written in python3 contains the main code which includes the function AstarSearch. The function requires 2 input files: nodes.csv and edges.csv and will generate 1 output file: path.csv. the file path can be defined and changed in the main function of the script. Please read the comments in the code for detail information. 

"results" folder with four files in it: nodes.csv, edges.csv, obstacles.csv, and path.csv. The edges.csv file is modified with the edge from node 4 to node 7 deleted. node.csv and obstacles.csv are identical as the wiki. The path.csv file is the output of code.py
