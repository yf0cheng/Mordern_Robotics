This folder is for Peer-graded Assignment: Modern Robotics Course 3 Wk2 (Robot Dynamics) Project. 

code.py written in python3 contains the main code which includes the function course3wk2final, and the main function is running 2 simulations specified in the assignment. The function, course3wk2final, saves the robot configuration for specified time duration. 

simulation 1: 
The robot falling from the zero (home) configuration for 3 seconds.

simulation 2: 
The robot falling from a configuration where all joints are at their zero position, except for joint 2, which is at -âˆ’1 radian. This simulation should last 5 seconds.
